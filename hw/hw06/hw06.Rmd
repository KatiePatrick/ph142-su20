* Due date: Tuesday, July 28th 10:00pm.
* Remember: autograder is meant as sanity check ONLY. It will not tell you if you have the correct answer. It will tell you if you are in the ball park of the answer so *CHECK YOUR WORK*.
* Submission process: Follow the submission instructions on the final page. Make sure you do not remove any `\newpage` tags or rename this file, as this will break the submission.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# Don't change these lines, just run them!

```

Helpful hints:

- Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. 
Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration! **You must knit correctly before submitting.**

- If your code runs off the page of the knitted PDF then you will LOSE POINTS! To
avoid this, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the 
file (you can easily view it on Gradescope via the provided link after submitting). 
If it doesn't look right, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using 
the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

**Section 1: Poission Distribution**

Oregon is not known for experiencing tornadoes. Oregon experiences a constant rate of about 3 tornadoes
per year on average.

1. [1 point] Assuming that tornadoes are random and independent, with a 
constant rate of 3 per year, the count of perceptible tornadoes per year in 
Oregon should have a Poisson distribution with mean 3. What is the standard 
deviation of the number of tornadoes per year? Round to the nearest 3 decimal places.

```{r calculate-sd}
sd_tornado <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
sd_tornado 

check_problem1()

```

\newpage

2. [1 point] Making the same assumptions as in part (a), use one or two R functions to 
compute the probability of seeing two or less tornadoes per year. Round your answer to three decimal places.

```{r tornado-prob}
probability <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
probability

check_problem2()

```

\newpage

3. [2 points] Do the same calculation as above, this time using only a hand 
calculator. Show your work and round your final percentage to two decimal places.

[TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE]


\newpage

4. [1 point] In 1995, Oregon experienced 4 tornadoes. Assuming the same model as above, write an equation to show how the chance of experiencing 4 tornadoes or more can be written as a function of the probability at or below some $k$. 

(Note: You can write these equations using pen and paper and upload the image if
you'd like. You can also write the equations using plain text (i.e., P(X >= k)).
If you would like to use math equations that render when you knit the pdf 
(i.e., $P(X>=k)$) you need to be **very careful** with your symbols. For example, to get the symbol for "greater than or equal to" you cannot copy and paste it into R from the slides or another document. This will cause errors! Instead you need to write $P(X \geq k)$. Again, use any of these three methods (hand-written, plain text in R, or "math equations between dollar signs", and you will get points 
so long as it is human-readable.) 

<Note: If you are uploading an image (this is optional), use the following code, or delete if not using.BE SURE TO REMOVE THE OPTION "eval = F" if using this code OR IT WON'T RUN when you knit the file!:>

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%", eval=F}
library(knitr)
#include_graphics("src/your-scans-name.jpg")
# Once you replace the above line with your file's name (after uploading the file
# to datahub's Image sub-directory) you can execute the line of code and 
# verify that the image is printed below the code chunk.
```

\newpage

5. [1 point] Using R, calculate the probability of observing 4 tornadoes or more. Your answer should be a number between 0 and 1 rounded to three decimal places.

```{r earthquake-109}
probability_4_or_more <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
probability_4_or_more

check_problem5()
```

\newpage

6. [2 points] Based on your answer in question (5), would you conclude that the 
mean number of tornadoes has increased? Why or why not? Would 
knowing that the number of tornades was 3 in 1998 support your 
conclusion?

**Section 2: Normal Approximation of Binomial Distribution**

To track epidemics, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention requires 
physicians to report all cases of important transmissible diseases. From January 22nd to May 30th,
a total of 1,320,488 cases of COVID-19 were officially reported in the United States, 13.8% of which 
were individuals in their 20s. Assume this 13.8% stays the same every year.
Researchers plan to take a simple random sample of 400 diagnosed cases of 
COVID-19 to study the risk factors associated with the disease. Call $\hat{p}$
the proportion of cases in the sample corresponding to individuals in their 20s. 

7 [1 point] What is the mean of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ in random samples of size 400?

```{r sampling-dist-mean}
sampling_dist_mean <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
sampling_dist_mean
check_problem7()
```


\newpage

8. [1 point] What is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ in random samples of size 400? Round your answer to 3 decimal places.

```{r sampling-dist-sd}
sampling_dist_sd <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
sampling_dist_sd
check_problem8()
```


\newpage

9. [3 points] Describe the conditions required for the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ to be Normally distributed. Use the numbers provided in the question to check if the conditions are likely met.

**Section 3: Margin of Error and Bias**

Read [this short article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/upshot/when-you-hear-the-margin-of-error-is-plus-or-minus-3-percent-think-7-instead.html)
in the New York Times Upshot from 2016. (All Berkeley students should have access to a free NY Times subscription.)

10. [2 points] Explain sampling variation, in the context of this article. Does the 3 percentage point margin of error account for sampling variation?

[TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE]


\newpage

11. [1 point] The authors provides several reasons why the true margin of error is larger than three percent. Describe one of the primary reasons provided in 1-2 sentences.

[TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE]


\newpage

12. [1 point] Based on the information in article, if we're doing a study in public health, choose the answer that is most correct:

    (a) The confidence interval accounts for random error only. If a study suffers
    from other sources of bias (i.e., confounding, or mismeasurement) the CI will
    not account for this limitation.
    (b) Increasing the sample size will reduce the chance of other sources of bias
    (i.e., confounding, or mismeasurement), which is why a larger sample is better.
    (c) both (a) and (b)
    d) neither (a) or (b)

Assign your letter choice as a string. Example: nytimes_answer <- "c"
```{r nytimes-answer}
nytimes_answer <- "REPLACE WITH a, b, c, or d. Keep the quotes"
nytimes_answer
check_problem12()
```

**Section 4: Confidence Intervals and p-values**

Deer mice are small rodents native in North America. Their adult body lengths (excluding tail) are known to vary approximately Normally, with mean $\mu=87$ mm and standard deviation $\sigma=8$ mm. It is suspected that depending on their  environment, deer mice may adapt and deviate from these usual lengths. A random sample of $n=22$ deer mice in a rich forest habitat gives an average body length  of $\bar{x}=91.1$ mm. Assume that the standard deviation $\sigma$ of all deer mice in this area is 8 mm.

13. [1 point] Calculate a 99% confidence interval based on this information (you can use R as a calculator to perform the calculation, or use a hand calculator). Round your final values to three decimal places.

```{r CI99-rodents}
lower_tail <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE LOWER BOUND"
upper_tail <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE UPPER BOUND"
ci_99 <- c(lower_tail, upper_tail)

check_problem13()
```

\newpage

14. [1 point] Interpret the confidence interval from Problem 14.

[TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE]


\newpage

15. [2 points] Suppose deer mice researchers thought your CI was too wide to be 
useful. Given that you cannot change the standard deviation, what two things 
could you do to provide a narrower confidence interval? 

[TODO: YOUR ANSWER HERE]


\newpage

16. [1 point] You decide to create a 95% confidence interval, rather than a 99% 
confidence interval. Perform this calculation below and round your answer to 3 decimal places.

```{r CI95-rodents}
lower_tail95 <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE LOWER BOUND"
upper_tail95 <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE UPPER BOUND"
ci_95 <- c(lower_tail95, upper_tail95)

check_problem16()
```

\newpage

17. [2 points] 

(a) Based on this 95% CI, is there evidence against the hypothesis 
$H_0$ that these mice have a significantly different mean length compared to the 
population described in the first part of the question? \\

(b) Without performing a calculation, what amounts do you know the p-value to be 
bounded between for a two-sided hypothesis test of $H_0$? 

Hint: 
Use information from question 16 and from question 13.

**Section 5: Z-test**

We want to perform a z-test with the two-sided alternative hypothesis the true mean length is not equal to 87mm. In the next four problems, we will conduct a z-test step by step.

\newpage

18. [1 point] Write out the null and alternative hypotheses for the above problem using notation. You can do this in words or in notation. If you choose notation, this is the LaTex symbol for $\mu$.

\newpage

19. [1 point] Calculate the z test statistic. Round your answer to 3 decimal places.

```{r calc-z-stat}
z_stat <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE LOWER BOUND"
z_stat

check_problem19()
```


\newpage

20. [1 point] Calculate the p-value as a decimal. Round your answer to 3 decimal places. Remember you are conducting a two-sided test.

```{r calc-p-val}
p_val <- "REPLACE WITH YOUR ANSWER FOR THE LOWER BOUND"
p_val

check_problem20()
```


\newpage

21. [1 point] Interpret your above p-value.
