* Remember: autograder is meant as sanity check ONLY. It will not tell you if you have the correct answer. It will tell you if you are in the ball park of the answer so *CHECK YOUR WORK*.
* Submission process: Follow the submission instructions on the final page. Make sure you do not remove any `\newpage` tags or rename this file, as this will break the submission.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# Don't change these lines, just run them!
source("setup/hw09.RAGS.R")
```

Helpful hints:

-  Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. 
Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration! **You must knit correctly before submitting.**

- If your code runs off the page of the knitted PDF then you will LOSE POINTS! To
avoid this, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the 
file (you can easily view it on Gradescope via the provided link after submitting). 
If it doesn't look right, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using 
the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

### Section 1: Abstract interpretation [3 points]
Read the following abstract and answer the questions that follow. 

Webb, A. L., Dugan, A., Burchett, W., Barnett, K., Patel, N., Morehead, S., Silverberg, M., Doty, C., Adkins, B., & Falvo, L. (2015). Effect of a Novel Engagement Strategy Using Twitter on Test Performance. The western journal of emergency medicine, 16(6), 961â€“964. https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2015.10.28869

**OBJECTIVE:**
Medical educators in recent years have been using social media for more penetrance to technologically-savvy learners. The utility of using Twitter for curriculum content delivery has not been studied. We sought to determine if participation in a social media-based educational supplement would improve student performance on a test of clinical images at the end of the semester.

**METHODS:**
116 second-year medical students were enrolled in a lecture-based clinical medicine course, in which images of common clinical exam findings were presented. An additional, optional assessment was performed on Twitter. Each week, a clinical presentation and physical exam image (not covered in course lectures) were distributed via Twitter, and students were invited to guess the exam finding or diagnosis. After the completion of the course, students were asked to participate in a slideshow "quiz" with 24 clinical images, half from lecture and half from Twitter.

**RESULTS:**
We conducted a one-way analysis of variance to determine the effect Twitter participation had on total, Twitter-only, and lecture-only scores. Twitter participation data was collected from the end-of-course survey and was defined as submitting answers to the Twitter-only questions "all or most of the time", "about half of the time", and "little or none of the time." We found a significant difference in overall scores (p<0.001) and in Twitter-only scores (p<0.001). There was not enough evidence to conclude a significant difference in lecture-only scores (p=0.124). Students who submitted answers to Twitter "all or most of the time" or "about half the time" had significantly higher overall scores and Twitter-only scores (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) than those students who only submitted answers "little or none of the time." 

**CONCLUSIONS:**
While students retained less information from Twitter than from traditional classroom lecture, some retention was noted. Future research on social media in medical education would benefit from clear control and experimental groups in settings where quantitative use of social media could be measured. Ultimately, it is unlikely for social media to replace lecture in medical curriculum; however, there is a reasonable role for social media as an adjunct to traditional medical education.

3. [1 point] What test must the researchers have gone on to perform to conclude that students who submitted answers to Twitter "all or most of the time" or "about half the time" had significantly higher overall scores and Twitter-only scores than those students who only submitted answers "little or none of the time"? Uncomment one of the choices below.

```{r p3}
# p3 <- "ANOVA"

### Section 2: ANOVA and Tukey's HSD [6 points]
For this question we will use data from the UCI Heart Disease dataset.

```{r read}
# Read CSV into R
heart <- read_csv("heart.csv")
# Convert cp into a factor variable
heart$cp <- as.factor(heart$cp)

head(heart)
```

\newpage

4. [1 point] Generate the mean and standard deviations in a dataframe for resting blood pressure `trestbps` by chest pain type `cp`. Use dplyr functions.

```{r p4, message=FALSE}
p4 <- "YOUR CODE HERE"
p4


check_problem4()
```

\newpage

5. [1 point] Create a boxplot that helps you to visualize these data.

```{r p5}
p5 <- "YOUR PLOT HERE"
p5


check_problem5()
```

\newpage

6. [2 points]  Conduct an ANOVA for these data and assign to the variable `anova`. Then conduct a Tukey's HSD test and assign your model to the variable `tukey`.

```{r p6, warning = FALSE}
anova <- "YOUR CODE HERE"
tukey <- "YOUR CODE HERE"
p6 <- tidy(tukey) #keep this line
p6


check_problem6()

### Section 3: Non-parametric [3 points]
You are testing the change in test scores following an intensive tutoring session. You have the following data from a small group of students each student is tested before and after the tutoring session. Each row represents one student.  

|Time 1   |Time 2|
|---------|------|
|65       |77    |
|87       |100   |
|77       |75    |
|90       |89    |
|70       |80    |
|84       |81    |
|92       |91    |
|83       |96    |
|85       |84    |

For assignments in this class, you'll be submitting using the **Terminal** tab in the pane below. In order for the submission to work properly, make sure that:

1. Any image files you add that are needed to knit the file are in the `src` folder and file paths are specified accordingly. 
2. You **have not changed the file name** of the assignment.
3. The file is saved (the file name in the tab should be **black**, not red with an asterisk).
4. The file knits properly.

Once you have checked these items, you can proceed to submit your assignment.

1. Click on the **Terminal** tab in the pane below.
2. Copy-paste the following line of code into the terminal and press enter.

cd; cd ph142-su20/hw/hw09; python3 turn_in.py
