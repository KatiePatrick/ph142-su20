### The Normal Distribution N(0,1)

- Here is a Normal distribution with mean ($\mu$) = 0, standard deviation ($\sigma$) = 1 .

```{r load-libraries2, echo=F, out.width = "70%", warning=F, message=F}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(latex2exp)
library(dplyr)

#students, you don't need to know how to use stat_function()
p1 <- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-3, 3)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), col = "orange") +
  labs(y = "density") + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 0, y = 0.45), label = "mean = 0 \nsd = 1", check_overlap = T, col = "orange") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-5, 5)) + theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

p1
```

### The Normal Distribution N(0,1) and N(2,1)
- Let's add another Normal distribution, this one centered at 2, with the same
standard deviation

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"}
p1 <- p1 + stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 2, sd = 1), col = "blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 2, y = 0.45), label = "mean = 2 \nsd = 1", check_overlap = T, col = "blue") 
p1
```

### The Normal Distribution N(O,1) and N(2,1) and N(-2,0.5)

- Let's add a third Normal distribution, this one centered at -2, with a standard
deviation of 0.5

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"}
p1 <- p1 + stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = -2, sd = 0.5), col = "forest green")  +
  geom_text(aes(x = -2, y = 0.85), label = "mean = -2 \nsd = 0.5", check_overlap = T, col = "forest green") 
p1
```

### The Normal Distribution

- Notice what happens when we make the standard deviation smaller (i.e., the spread is reduced)
- Why is the distribution "taller"?

### The Normal Distribution

- Can you guess what a Normal distribution with $\mu=1$ and $\sigma=2.5$ would
look like compared to the others?

### The Normal Distribution

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"}
p1 <- p1 + stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 1, sd = 1.5))  +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1, y = 0.3), label = "mean = 1 \nsd = 2.5", check_overlap = T) 
p1
```

### Properties of the Normal distribution

- the mean $\mu$ can be any value, positive or negative
- the standard deviation $\sigma$ must be a positive number
- the mean is equal to the median (both = $\mu$)
- the standard deviation captures the spread of the distribution
- the height of the curve at each point represents the probability of observing that value (however we never calculate probabilities for an exact value, only for ranges...why?)
- the area under the Normal distribution is equal to 1 (i.e., it is a density function)
- a Normal distribution is completely determined by its $\mu$ and $\sigma$

## The 68-95-99.7 rule

### The 68-95-99.7 rule for approximation in all Normal distributions

- Approximately 68% of the data fall within one standard deviation of the mean
- Approximately 95% of the data fall within two standard deviations of the mean
- Approximately 99.7% of the data fall within three standard deviations of the mean

Written probabilistically:

- $P(\mu - \sigma < X < \mu + \sigma) \approx 68\%$
- $P(\mu - 2\sigma < X < \mu + 2\sigma) \approx 95\%$
- $P(\mu - 3\sigma < X < \mu + 3\sigma) \approx 99.7\%$

###  Calculations using the 68-95-99.7 rule
Remembering that the normal curve is symmetric we then also know:

- $P(X < \mu - \sigma) \approx 16\%$ 
- $P(X > \mu + \sigma) \approx 16\%$ 
- $P(X < \mu - 2\sigma) \approx 2.5\%$
- $P(X > \mu + 2\sigma) \approx 2.5\%$
- $P(X < \mu - 3\sigma ) \approx .15\%$
- $P(X > \mu - 3\sigma ) \approx .15\%$

### Calculations using the 68-95-99.7 rule

Example 11.1 from Baldi & Moore on the heights of young women. The distribution 
of heights of young women is approximately Normal, with mean $\mu=64.5$ inches 
and standard deviation $\sigma=2.5$ inches.
- i.e., $H \sim N(64.5, 2.5)$, where H is defined as the height of a young woman

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"}
#students, you don't need to know this code

  geom_segment(aes(x = 64.5+3*2.5 , y = 0, xend = 64.5+3*2.5, yend = 0.1), lty = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 64.5-3*2.5 , y = 0, xend = 64.5-3*2.5, yend = 0.1), lty = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(64.5-2*2.5, 64.5-2.5, 64.5, 64.5+2.5, 64.5+2*2.5), 
                     labels = c("59.5\n-2 SD", "62\n-1 SD", "64.5\nmean", "67\n+1 SD", "69.5\n+2 SD"),

  geom_label(aes(x = 64.5, y = 0.025), label = "99.7%", fill = "#ec7014")

### Calculations using the 68-95-99.7 rule
$\mu=64.5$ inches and standard deviation $\sigma=2.5$ inches

- What calculations could you do with just the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ values and this rule?

- P(62 < H < 67) = ?
- P(H > 62) = ?

- Thinking back to the article about height - who would we consider "taller than normal" in these data?


## Finding Normal probabilities

### Finding Normal probabilities

- A cumulative probability for a value x in a distribution is the proportion of 
observations in the distribution that lie at or below x.
- Here is the cumulative probability for x=1.2

```{r, out.width="80%", echo=F}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(-4, 1.2)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  geom_segment(x = 1.2, xend = 1.2, y = 0 , yend = 0.195) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -4:4) + 
  labs(y = "density")
```

### Finding Normal probabilities

- Recall that 100% of the sample space for the random variable x lies under the 
probability density function.
- What is the amount of the area that is below x = 1.2?
- To answer this question we use the `pnorm()` function:

```{r cumulative-prob-below}
pnorm(q = 1.2, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

### Finding Normal probabilities

What if we wanted the reverse: P(x>1.2)?

```{r, out.width="80%", echo=F}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(1.2, 4)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  geom_segment(x = 1.2, xend = 1.2, y = 0 , yend = 0.195) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -4:4) + labs(y = "density")
```

```{r probability-above}
1 - pnorm(q = 1.2, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

Alternatively: 

```{r alternative-prob-above}
 pnorm(q = 1.2, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = F)
```

So, 11.51% of the data is above x=1.2.

### Finding Normal probabilities

What if we wanted two "tail" probabilities?: $P(x< -1.2 \text{ or } x>1.2)$?

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(1.2, 4)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(-4, -1.2)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  geom_segment(x = 1.2, xend = 1.2, y = 0 , yend = 0.195) + 
  geom_segment(x = -1.2, xend = -1.2, y = 0 , yend = 0.195) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -4:4) + labs(y = "density")
```

### Finding Normal probabilities

The trick: find one of the tails and then double the area because the distribution
is symmetric:

```{r}
pnorm(q = -1.2, mean = 0, sd = 1)*2
```

### Finding Normal probabilities

What if we wanted a range in the middle?: $P(-0.8 < x < 1.5)$?

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(-0.8, 1.5)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  geom_segment(x = 1.5, xend = 1.5, y = 0 , yend = 0.13) + 
  geom_segment(x = -0.8, xend = -0.8, y = 0 , yend = 0.29) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -4:4) + labs(y = "density")
```

### Finding Normal probabilities

```{r steps}
# step 1: calculate the probability *below* the upper bound (x=1.5)
pnorm(q = 1.5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
# step 2: calculate the probability *below* the lower bound (x = -0.8)
pnorm(q = -0.8, mean = 0, sd = 1)
# step 3: take the difference between these probabilities 
pnorm(q = 1.5, mean = 0, sd = 1) - pnorm(q = -0.8, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

Thus, 72.13% of the data is in the range -0.8 < x < 1.5.

### Your turn 

To diagnose osteoporosis, bone mineral density is measured. The WHO criterion for 
osteoporosis is a BMD score below -2.5. Women in their 70s have a much lower BMD
than younger women. Their BMD ~ N(-2, 1). What proportion of these women have a
BMD below the WHO cutoff?

```{r osteoporosis, echo=FALSE}
#to fill in during class

pnorm(q=-2.5, mean=-2, sd= 1 )
```


## Finding Normal percentiles

### Finding Normal percentiles

Recap: so far, we have calculated the *probability* using `pnorm()` given 
specific values for x.

Sometimes we want to go in the opposite direction: We might be given the 
probability within some range and tasked with finding the corresponding x-values.

### Finding Normal percentiles

Example: The hatching weights of commercial chickens can be modeled accurately
using a Normal distribution with mean $\mu=45$ grams and standard deviation 
$\sigma=4$ grams. What is the third quartile of the distribution of hatching 
weights?

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(29, 61)), aes(x)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 45, sd = 4), fill = "#ec7014", xlim = c(29, 47.7)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 45, sd = 4)) +
  geom_segment(x = 47.69796, xend = 47.69796, y = 0 , yend = 0.08) + 
  labs(y = "density") +
  geom_text(aes(x = 44, y = 0.05), check_overlap = T, label = "75%", col = "white", size = 8) 
```

### Finding Normal percentiles using the `qnorm()` function

Example: The hatching weights of commercial chickens can be modeled accurately
using a Normal distribution with mean $\mu=45$ grams and standard deviation 
$\sigma=4$ grams. What is the third quartile of the distribution of hatching 
weights?

```{r}
qnorm(p = 0.75, mean = 45, sd = 4)
```

Thus, 75% of the data is below 47.7 for this distribution.


## The standard normal and Z scores

###Convert to a standard
A normal distribution can have an infinite number of possible values for its mean and sd. 

It would be impossible to tabulate the area associated with each and every normal curve

So instead of doing the impossible, we convert to the **Standard Normal** Distribution
 
### The standard Normal distribution
- The standard Normal distribution N(0,1) has $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma=1$.
- $X \sim N(0,1)$, implies that the random variable X is Normally distributed.

```{r, echo=F, out.width="75%"}
p1 <- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-3, 3)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), col = "orange") +
  labs(y = "density", x = "") + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 0, y = 0.45), label = "mean = 0 \nsd = 1", check_overlap = T, col = "orange") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0 , y = 0, xend = 0, yend = 0.4)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 1 , y = 0, xend = 1, yend = 0.25), lty = 2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -1 , y = 0, xend = -1, yend = 0.25), lty = 2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 2 , y = 0, xend = 2, yend = 0.05), lty = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -2 , y = 0, xend = -2, yend = 0.05), lty = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -3:3, 
                     labels = c(-3, "-2\n-2 SD", "-1\n-1 SD", "0\nmean", "1\n+1 SD", "2\n+2 SD", 3))
p1
```

### Standardizing Normally distributed data

- Any random variable that follows a Normal distribution can be standardized
- If $x$ is an observation from a distribution that has a mean $\mu$ and a 
standard deviation $\sigma$, 

$$z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$
   
###What's the Z 

By converting our variable of interest $X$ to $Z$ we can use the probabilities of the standard normal probability distribution to estimate the probabilities associated with $X$.

- A standardized value is often called a **z-score**
- Interpretation: $z$ is the number of standard deviations that $x$ is above or
below the mean of the data.

## Simulating Normally distributed data in R

### Simulating Normally distributed data in R

Suppose that we measured 1000 heights for young women:

```{r simulate-height-data}
#students, rnorm() is important to know!
heights.women <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 64.5, sd = 2.5)
heights.women <- data.frame(heights.women)
```

### Simulating Normally distributed data in R
We can plot the histogram of the heights, and see that they roughly follow from
a Normal distribution:

```{r plot heights, out.width="80%", echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
hist <- ggplot(heights.women, aes(x = heights.women)) + geom_histogram(col = "white") + theme_minimal(base_size = 15) 

dens <- ggplot(heights.women, aes(x = heights.women)) + geom_density() + stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = c(mean = 64.5, sd = 2.5), col = "forest green") + theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

hist + dens + plot_layout()
```

### Standardizing Normally distributed data in R

To standard these data, we can apply the formula to compute the z-value:

```{r compute-z-value}
heights.women <- heights.women %>% mutate(mean = mean(heights.women), 
                                          sd = sd(heights.women), 
                                          z = (heights.women - mean)/sd)

head(heights.women)
```

What would the distribution of the standardized heights look like?

### Standardizing Normally distributed data in R

```{r plot-z-scores, warning=F, message=F, out.width="80%", echo=F, }
hist_z <- ggplot(heights.women, aes(x = z)) + geom_histogram(col = "white") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) 

dens_z <- ggplot(heights.women, aes(x = z)) + geom_density() + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = c(mean = 0, sd = 1), col = "forest green") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

hist_z + dens_z + plot_layout()
```



## The Normal quantile plot (a.k.a the Q-Q plot)

### The Normal quantile plot (a.k.a the Q-Q plot)

- The purpose of making a Q-Q plot is to examine the Normality of a distribution
of a variable.

- If you want to know whether variable is Normally distributed you could examine 
its histogram to see if it is unimodal and symmetric. However, it is still sometimes
hard to say if it is truly Normal. To do so you can use a Q-Q plot.

### Are these data Normally distributed?

- The data is unimodal and symmetric, but is its distribution Normal?

```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
library(ggplot2)
example_data <- data.frame(y = rt(200, df = 5))

ggplot(example_data, aes(y)) + geom_histogram(col = "white") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Making a QQ plot step by step

1. First, arrange the variable in ascending order. Calculate the percentile for each measurement.
For example if you had ten measurements in ascending order, the first measurement is at the 
10th percentile because 10% of the data is at or below its value. The second measurement
is at the 20% because 20% of the data is at or below its value, and so forth.
2. Then, for each of the percentiles you calculated, use that percentile to calculate
the corresponding x-value of the Normal distribution that occurs at that percentile.
For example, at x = -1 at the 16th percentile of the N(0, 1) distribution.
3. Make a scatter plot of the calculated x-values on the x-axis and the original
variable values on the y-axis.
4. The closer the data is to a straight line, the more closely it approximates
a Normal distribution.

### Making a QQ plot step by step

```{r qqplot-calcs, message=FALSE}
#1. calculate the percentile :
example_data <- example_data %>%  arrange(y) %>% 
  mutate(quantile = row_number()/n())
# 2. then calculate the x-value at each percentile from the previous step
# 3. this x-value can be called a z-score because it is from the standard Normal distribution
example_data <- example_data %>% 
  mutate(z_score = qnorm(quantile, mean = 0, sd = 1))
head(example_data)
```

### Look at the QQ plot for these data

- Notice that the data overlays the 45 degree line in the middle but not in the 
tails of the distribution. This sort of pattern shows that these data are "wider"
(have larger standard deviation) that a Normally distributed variable.

```{r qqplots, out.width="75%", fig.align=T, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(example_data, aes(x = z_score, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Easy way to make a qqplot() where R does all the calculating for you

```{r, out.width="75%", fig.align=T}
ggplot(example_data, aes(sample = y)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Another example:  Seed Data
```{r}
library(readr)
seed_data <- read_csv("Ch04_seed-data")

head(seed_data)
```

### Another example
Check out its distribution. It definitely does not look normal:

```{r, out.width="70%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(seed_data, aes(x = seed_count)) + 
  geom_histogram(col = "white") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Another example

And look at its QQ plot. Does the data appear to follow a Normal distribution? 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(seed_data, aes(sample = seed_count)) + 
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Another example (logged)

You might remember that we took the log of seed_count before we used it in regression. The log values look like this:

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(seed_data, aes(x = log(seed_count))) + 
  geom_histogram(col = "white", binwidth = 2) + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Another example (logged)

How does the QQ plot look for the logged variable?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(seed_data, aes(sample = log(seed_count))) + 
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 15)) 
```

### QQ plot summary

- Review the QQ plots from the book on page 290-292 of B&M Edition 4
- Try and gain intuition about when a variable does not appear to fit a Normal distribution
    - Was the distribution skewed?
    - Was there an outlier?
- For each scenario how do these deviations from Normality affect the QQ plot?
